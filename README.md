# Machine-Translation

A project focused on **German to English** machine translation using various deep learning models such as **LSTM, RNN, Bi-directional LSTM**, and the **Encoder-Decoder architecture**.

## ðŸ§  About

Machine Translation is the process of automatically translating text from one language to another without human involvement. This project explores different sequence modeling techniques to perform translation from German to English.

The dataset used originates from the **ACL 2014 Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation**, which emphasizes translation between European language pairs. The goal of this workshop â€” and this project â€” is to build tools that enable effective communication across languages, helping bridge cultural and linguistic gaps.

## ðŸš€ Techniques Implemented

- **Simple RNN-based Translation Model**
- **LSTM-based Seq2Seq Model**
- **Bidirectional LSTM-based Model**
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**

## ðŸ“š Dataset

- **Source**: ACL 2014 - Ninth Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation
- **Language Pair**: German â†’ English
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, lowercasing, vocabulary building, and padding

## ðŸ§¾ Requirements

- tensorflow / keras
- numpy
- pandas
- nltk
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
